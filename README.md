# rbg-image-classifier-keras
This repository contains the coursework to create and compare new and pretrained deep learning networks using Keras.

## How to start?
````bash
git clone https://github.com/WiebkeFr/rbg-image-classifier-keras.git # in google drive directory
# open files in Google Collab
# adjust file-paths according to location
# run code segments
````

## Coursework
##### 1. Task
Separate the three channels of the RGB images and train convolutional neural network to classify the three images and sum the numbers.

##### 2. Task
Compare pretrained Keras networks to classify images:
- Xception
- VGG16
- ResNet50
- ResNet50V2
- ResNet101
- ResNet101V2
- InceptionV3
- MobileNet
- DenseNet121
- DenseNet169
- EfficientB0

##### 3. Task
Create and compare four different models of neural network to classify the images
